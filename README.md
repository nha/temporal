  GreetingWorkflow
  (^String getGreeting [param-not-this] "say something yo"))
  
(t/def-activity-interface
  GreetingActivities
  (composeGreeting [^String greeting ^String n]))

(def reified-workflow
  (reify GreetingWorkflow
    (getGreeting [this s]
      (let [a (t/activity-stub GreetingActivities)]
        (.composeGreeting a "HELLO " s)))))
        
...
