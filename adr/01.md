Due to the need to generate Java interfaces that have annotations and classes that also annotations
like these https://github.com/temporalio/samples-java/blob/d92d48ca4431d6ea6af564a2d303fad9a9d3521b/src/main/java/io/temporal/samples/hello/HelloActivity.java#L54-L81

Alternatives considered:
- clojure gen-interface and gen-class => KO because they are not good for annotations (it seems at first! read on..)
- Java => Would be acceptable, but the user of the library would have to write + compile some java code. This breaks the flow if REPLing
- nothing => no CLJ library for temporal
- ASM => bit of a pain but doable if REALLY needed ( https://github.com/jgpc42/insn/blob/3c12bb3c70e54e5091b79764c9776f72726266be/test/insn/core_test.clj#L263 and https://github.com/jgpc42/insn/blob/3c12bb3c70e54e5091b79764c9776f72726266be/test/insn/clojure_test.clj#L10 )
- hacky => undocumented support for annotations in clojure.core (https://groups.google.com/g/clojure/c/0hKOFQXAwRc?pli=1 + https://gist.github.com/richhickey/377213 )

=> of course I've gone the hacky way!

NOTE: could have asked the java-sdk folks too
